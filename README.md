This repository contains my hands-on practice while learning Pandas. It covers everyday tasks like creating DataFrames, exploring data, cleaning missing values, filtering rows, transforming columns, reshaping data, and combining multiple datasets.

All the data used in the code (CSV and JSON files) is included in the repository, so everything runs out of the box.

This repo is meant for learning, revision, and quick reference as I build confidence working with real-world data using Pandas.
