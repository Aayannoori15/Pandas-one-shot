# Pandas One Shot

A compact, hands-on repository for learning core data analysis workflows in Python, including SQL practice and file I/O exploration.

## Overview
This repository captures practical data analysis learning work:
- SQL query practice
- File I/O experimentation
- Early-stage notebook-based analysis

## Repository Structure
- `Data collection/oneshotsql.sql`: SQL practice queries.
- `Python file IO/thinkingData.ipynb`: Notebook focused on data loading and file handling.
- `Python file IO/amazonreviews.json`: JSON dataset used for file I/O/data handling exercises.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL
- JSON/CSV-style data workflows

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a Python environment.
3. Install common analysis dependencies:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
4. Open notebooks with Jupyter Lab/Notebook.

## Learning Focus
- Reading and writing structured data files
- Basic cleaning and transformation patterns
- Building confidence with exploratory analysis workflows

## Next Improvements
- Add a `requirements.txt`
- Add dataset documentation (`data_dictionary.md`)
- Add screenshots/results for key notebook outputs
